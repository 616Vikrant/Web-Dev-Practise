            <h2> About me</h2>
            <img src="photo valid.jpg" height="250" width="200">
            <p>I'm a curious learner with an experience in wide range of disciplines.

                You can also call me an aspiring web designer, front-end developer, creative writer, UI, UX or by any other similar function-title. I'm also a multi-disciplinary maker looking for experiences in design disciplines, front-end developer, open source contributor, community moderator, mentor, campus ambassador, blogger, creative writter, tech enthusiast, traveler and more.
                
                I don't like to define myself by the work I've done. I define myself by the work I want to do. Skills can be taught, personality is inherent. I prefer to keep learning, continue challenging myself, and do interesting things that matter.
                
                Fueled by high energy levels and boundless enthusiasm, I'm easily inspired and more than willing to follow my fascinations wherever they take me. I'm passionate, expressive, mutli-talented spirit with a natural ability to entertain and inspire. I'm never satisfied to just come up with ideas. Instead, I have an almost impulsive need to act on them.
                
                I enjoy learning new technologies and implementing them. Currently, I am focused on competitive programing and exploring new things as there's always something new to learn. I am also very interested in the field of defence.
                
                My abundant energy fuels me in the pursuit of many interests, hobbies, areas of study and artistic endeavours. I'm an avid learner, able to pick up new skills and juggle different tasks and roles with relative ease.</p>
